# Progression Outcomes Predictor

### Description

An application developed during the first semester of my degree program.
This specific program will predict the progression outcome at the end of each academic year by taking the credits at pass, refer and defer as inputs.
Included there are five versions of this program each with slight alterations than the other.

* Part 1 - (Student Version) <br>
  Will take the inputs and display the progression outcome at the end of academic year.<br>
  
* Part 2 - (Student Version with validation)<br>
  Functions the same way as part 1. Additionally all the inputs goes through some validations.<br>
  
* Part 3 - (Staff Version)<br>
  Has all the functionalities of part 2. Additionally staff version will have the ability to predict the progression outcomes of several students in a single run. 
  A histogram will be displayed at the end showing all the details of the entered data.<br>
  
* Part 4 - (Staff Version with Vertical Histogram)<br>
  Functions the same way as in part 3. Additionally a vertical histogram will be displayed.<br>
  
* Part 5 - (Alternative Staff Version)<br> 
  Functions the same way as in part 3 but instead of getting the inputs from the user, inpts will be read from a list.
